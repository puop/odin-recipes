# odin-recipes
This is a training project.
I will create a site that will display recipes
I will use git to save my code to github


Leaving for the weekend....
I have on step 3 of the odin site.
Tips to remember
    git add.
    git commit
    git push

To clone a repository 
    git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git

Really awesome to use ´code .´ and ´google-chrome index.html´
